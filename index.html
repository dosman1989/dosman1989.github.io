        <h2>The Show's creation</h2>
        <p>The Get Down was created by Baz Luhrmann (known for The Great Gatsby, Romeo + Juliet, and Moulin Rouge), in a collaboration with Netflix, bringing this visually beautiful and compelling drama to the small screen. Luhrmann, in his genius, brought on various rap and hip hop artists as advisors and producers (Nas, Grandmaster Flash). This gives The Get Down that edgy feel where you find yourself hoping this is a true depiction of History and not a piece of fiction, created by a team of screenwriters in a studio hoping to sound real.
<h2>Naming a show</h2>
The name The Get Down, refers refers to the essential rhythm part of a record. As opposed to the violins and singing and all that jazz, which is the “wack”. This is all made clear, early on in a scene where a young Grandmaster Flash attempts to teach Shaolin Fantastic and his group of get down brothers how to make a Hip Hop record.
The Get Down is a mythic saga of how New York at the brink of bankruptcy gave birth to hip-hop, punk and disco -- told through the lives and music of the South Bronx kids who changed the city, and the world...forever.

<h2> What’s it all about?</h2>
<p>
The Get Down focuses on the genesis of Hip Hop in 1970s New York City. Consigned to the rubble that was the Bronx in that era, a rag-tag crew of South Bronx teenagers are nothings and nobodies with no one to shelter them, except each other. Armed only with their raw talent, ability to spit rhymes, some magic markers and spray cans they hope to escape the bleak landscape of the Bronx and become successful artists the world over.</p>
